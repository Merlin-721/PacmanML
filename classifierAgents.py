#
# Some simple agents to work with the PacMan AI projects from:
#
# http://ai.berkeley.edu/
#
# These use a simple API that allow us to control Pacman's interaction with
# the environment adding a layer on top of the AI Berkeley code.
#
# As required by the licensing agreement for the PacMan AI we have:
#
# Licensing Information:  You are free to use or extend these projects for
# educational purposes provided that (1) you do not distribute or publish
# solutions, (2) you retain this notice, and (3) you provide clear
# attribution to UC Berkeley, including a link to http://ai.berkeley.edu.
# 
# Attribution Information: The Pacman AI projects were developed at UC Berkeley.
# The core projects and autograders were primarily created by John DeNero
# (denero@cs.berkeley.edu) and Dan Klein (klein@cs.berkeley.edu).
# Student side autograding was added by Brad Miller, Nick Hay, and
# Pieter Abbeel (pabbeel@cs.berkeley.edu).

# The agents here are extensions written by Simon Parsons, based on the code in
# pacmanAgents.py
